# Indoor air quality vulnerability along the urban-rural continuum: A neighbourhood classification of exposure for England and Wales

People living in the Global North spend most of their time indoors in the built environment, especially their homes. Indoor air pollution has therefore become a major health concern, particularly in urban environments. This analysis aims to understand the complex social and spatial drivers of vulnerability to poor indoor air quality by building a new classification at the neighbourhood scale across England and Wales. First we build three separate indices utilising a spectrum of open-source data: environmental, structural and human-related. Second, it uses cluster analysis to generate indoor air quality profiles for neighbourhoods, identifying key patterns and drivers of vulnerability that typify different geographies.
